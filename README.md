# **IPL Match Analysis & Visualization**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes and visualizes Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match data using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. It extracts key insights such as:  

- **Head-to-Head Performance** between two teams  
- **Top Players** (most runs, most wickets, strike rates, economy rates)  
- **Venue-based Performance** (home ground advantage)  
- **Toss Impact** on match results  
- **Win Percentage Analysis** across different IPL seasons  

The analysis is powered by two datasets:  
1. **`matches.csv`** – Contains match-level data, including teams, winners, venues, and player of the match.  
2. **`deliveries.csv`** – Ball-by-ball data for deeper performance analysis.
